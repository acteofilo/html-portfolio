    >My Web Development Career Journey</a
  >
</h2>

<p>
  I've alway found technology intriguing, and I get it. It's exciting.<br />
  I just didn't think I could make it in this field. It felt like it <br />
  was beyond my reach.<br />
  I grew up in Canada with immigrant parents that were not able to <br />
  provide support or encouragement and so I always thought that <br />
  it just wasn't for me, although I was always reading articles about<br />
  the what how and why of anything technological, go figure! <br />
  I finally figured out that it is for me and I'm actually good at it!

<p>
  There is no stopping me. My determination to succeed is imesurable.<br />
  As I grow older different versions of myself emerge.<br />
  And with every version, I want something more, something different. <br />
  I could live a comfortable life with what I have accomplished<br />
  and just continue doing the same job for the rest of my life, <br />
  but the passion was gone.<br />
  I became disatisfied, uncontent, unhappy.<br />

  I find joy and excitement in the unconfortable and so... <br />
  Now that I'm older, I decided to start over..go back to University...well not
  <br />
  back to - but for the first time actually, with students twice my age. <br />
  It was an amazing experience!<br />
  This is my journey... with no appologies.<br />
</p>
<h2><a name="My Academic Journey">My Academic Journey</a></h2>

<p>
  I graduated with a degree in Commerce with a major in <br />
  Business Technology Management from Toronto Metropolitan University (TMU)
  <br />
  During my time there, I was also working at finishing up <br />
  with my previous career while also working for the Government of Ontario,<br />
  as an Executive IT Officer Intern for 8 months, where I gained extensive<br />
  knowledge in applications administration and troubleshooting <br />
  amongst other things. It was a great learning experience, but the passion was
  missing,<br />
  and so my journey continueed for the search of something I could be passionate
  about.<br />
  I'm not of the type to do something just to do it, I need to love what I do.
</p>
<h2><a name="My Career Journey">My Career Journey</a></h2>

<p>
  Before attending TMU, I had exceptional success in contributing to the<br />
  substantial growth of a company in the beauty industry for 16 years.<br />
  I provided services to clients that exceeded expectation.<br />
  With a 500-client base, I created a very successful career. In addition,<br />
  I also managed and contributed to all aspects of the business, such as <br />
  training, education and contributing to the creation of promotional<br />
  advertising within the company, including managing social media accounts.<br />
</p>

<p>
  Then came that point in your life where you want something really<br />
  different...<br />
  another version of yourself emerges..<br />

  I decided to leave my old life and persue my fascination with technology.<br />
  I wasn't sure which route was best for me but I always dabbled in coding,
  <br />
  but always got a negative connotation whenever I looked at people who code
  <br />
  ( I was obvioulsy looking in the wrong place!)<br />
  - and so developed a Web Developer dream ;).<br />
</p>

<p>
  Of course, I couldn't have done it all without the assistance of my dog Lucy!
